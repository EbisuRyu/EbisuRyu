### Who Am I and What Do I Do? 🧑‍💻

I am a final year Computer Science student in the Honors Program at the University of Information Technology (VNU-HCM). My journey began with a deep passion for Mathematics, which earned me a Third Prize in the National Mathematics Olympiad. This foundation has fueled my curiosity to tackle complex problems and navigate complex challenges.

Currently, I am specializing in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, with a strong focus on bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical applications. Beyond AI research, I am honing my skills as a Software Engineer to effectively bring innovative ideas to life. I possess advanced proficiency in Python and am currently mastering modern JavaScript frameworks. I actively participate in tech competitions to challenge myself and build AI-driven solutions that create real-world impact.

Outside of tech, I balance my life through sports, meditation, and reading, always staying hungry for new knowledge.

### What Am I Currently Working On? 🚀

- Exploring advanced **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** techniques with a focus on practical applications.
- Strengthening my foundation in **software engineering** and **system design**.
- Preparing for a career as a **Machine Learning / AI Engineer**.
